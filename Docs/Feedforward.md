# Tips for Feedback Conversations

## Preparation

> Determine for yourself what you would like feedback on. Write down a few points in advance where you definitely want to receive feedback. This way, the feedback conversation will be more focused and the questions you definitely want answered will be addressed.

## During the Conversation:

> **Listen actively:** Do not immediately go on the defensive but try to listen well. Show both verbally and non-verbally that you are paying attention to the feedback by maintaining an open posture (eye contact, upright posture), taking notes, nodding...

> **Take notes:** Write down the feedback so you have it later. Note the key words and find a quick notation method for yourself. If you take good notes, you can briefly review your main feedback points at the end of the conversation.

> **Summarize:** Do not wait for a summary from the instructors, this is your task: Check if you have understood the message correctly by actively listening and summarizing in your own words.

> **Be open to the feedback:** Do not wait for a summary from the instructors, this is your task: Check if you have understood the message correctly by actively listening and summarizing in your own words.

> **Think about it:** Consider what you are going to do with the feedback and follow up. Do you find the comments justified or unjustified? Do you recognize yourself in the feedback? How are you going to address this?

## AFTER THE CONVERSATION

> Reread your notes and create action points. Make choices from all the feedback you received: What can you work on and what will you set aside for now. What were the priorities? Review the assignment sheet again to determine your focus points. Write your action points on the feedback sheet.

# Feedforward Conversations

## Conversation 1 (Date: 27/05/2025)

Lecturer: Tijn (Electronics - maker)

Questions for this conversation:

- Question 1: Is the box that I already had made good? What improvements can we make?  
- Question 2: How can we improve the camera placement for better image capture?  

This is the feedback on my questions.

- Feedback 1: Teacher confirmed it was good but suggested repositioning the camera. Plan: Create a hole in the box during XXL night for better camera placement.

## Conversation 2 (Date: 28/05/2025)

Lecturer: Paula (AI)


Questions for this conversation:

- Question 1: General question about my AI model, if it's good or not, and how we can improve it?
- Question 2: How do we determine the best augmentation settings for our dataset?

This is the feedback on my questions.

- Feedback 1: The Teacher said it needs more improvement by adding more images, also adding some augmentation to the model, retraining it, and trying to test it using images with some filters like black and white   

## Conversation 3 (Date: 2/06/2025)

Lecturer: Thomas (AI - Python)

Questions for this conversation:

- [x] Question 1: Asked about the AI Classification model, and if it is good, and what I need to do further?

This is the feedback on my questions.

- Feedback 1: The model is working quite well, but we also need to consider the detection of paintings using the camera. Therefore, the teacher advised me to train another detection model to detect paintings.

## Conversation 4 (Date: 12/06/2025)

Lecturer: Paula (AI - Python)

Questions for this conversation:

- [x] Question 1: Asked about the AI Classification model and how it can be improved, because it was only trained on high-quality images, but the webcam does not capture those high-quality images.
- [x] Question 2: Do I add augmentation to the model, even the picture that was taken from the webcam, to simulate a real-life scenario?

This is the feedback on my questions.

- Feedback 1: I should have taken Images from the webcam so I can simulate the real-life scenario and the very high-quality images, and yes I can add augmentation to help the model and improve the prediction.
  
## Conversation 5 (Date: 16/06/2025)

Lecturer: PJ (Electronics - maker)

Questions for this conversation:

- [x] Question 1:  The LCD is not working even after trying to change some code or wiring. And it was only the right side of the LCD 
  

This is the feedback on my questions.

- Feedback 1:  First, the teacher  tried another LCD screen with the  same code, and it ran fine, so the code was not the problem. It was the LCD itself on the right side. So the teacher PJ (Electronics - maker) gave me an LCD screen 
- 
## Tour Moment (Date 3/06/2025)
The teachers asked about the dataset of the models and the annotation process, and
how I'm planning to make them work. Also, the teachers gave a remark to use more of
the augmentation option in Roboflow to optimize the model(e.g, Hue), also check the
MD forward file, GitHub, and the toggle.

## Tour Moment (Date 10/06/2025)
The teachers took a look at the working model by running the code, it was the detection  model, and I was still working on the classification model also checked the confusion matrix  on colab for both models and then checked the feedforward.MD file, if everything is being noted in addition to the commit and push on Github, the teacher told me that I need to push more, and every time I update or do anything, it's better to commit and push. Then next was checking the Toggl part if everything was toggled correctly and with different categories.

## Tour Moment (Date 17/06/2025)
The teachers took a look at the working model by running the code and cheaking the communication with the hardware like LCD and camera The teachers tested it and also tried to include an style from artist outside of my model classes so they advised to add a text or message for that case, e.g., Artist not recognized. Also checked the poster and the instructables, in addition also the toggle in different categories and the commits history, and the feed forward.md of the  previous week.
